    <h2><strong>About Me:</strong></h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Brian! I live in Portland, OR. I'm married and the father to two wonderful children, Marla and Julian. My background is music performance and I have enjoyed a decade-long career as a composer, songwriter, recording engineer, and producer. Here you get to see the first steps of my newest adventure, <em>learning to code</em>. I am currently a student at <strong>Epicodus</strong> in their intensive JS Ruby and React bootcamp. This is an exciting frontier for me- I love to learn, although this undertaking has been one of the toughest challenges for me yet. Please check out my available projects in the links below and feel free to reach out with any thoughts and feeback. Thank you! </p>
